Putting on an event at Warwick and need some technical support? No problem, just contact us! We can provide a large 
range of equipment to help make your event a success.

Equipment can be provided on a **dry hire** basis, where you collect and return the equipment from our cupboard in 
Warwick Arts Centre, or as a **wet hire**, where we'll also provide technician(s) to operate and setup the equipment 
for you. Please note that in all cases, you'll be responsible for transport (such as providing a car for off-campus 
or far locations) and for the safe storage of any hired equipment.

Whilst we primarily work with other Warwick SU societies, we've also worked with external groups and clients such as 
independent productions and university departments. Payment is made after the event has taken place, and is 
typically completed via internal society transfer (or a Warwick SU invoice for external clients).

We're always happy to help out where we can, so even if you're not sure please still get in touch through our

or by emailing hires@warwicktechcrew.co.uk. Please contact us as early as possible to ensure equipment and 
technician availability.
