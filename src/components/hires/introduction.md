Putting on an event at Warwick and need some technical support? No problem, just contact us! We can provide a large
range of equipment to help make your event a success.

Equipment can be provided on a **dry hire** basis, where you collect and return the equipment from our cupboard in
Warwick Arts Centre, or as a **wet hire**, where we'll also provide technician(s) to operate and setup the equipment for
you. Please note that in all cases, you'll be responsible for transport (such as providing a car for off-campus or far
locations) and for the safe storage of any hired equipment.

Whilst we primarily work with other Warwick SU societies, we've also worked with external groups and clients such as
independent productions and university departments. Payment is made after the event has taken place, and is typically
completed via internal society transfer (or a Warwick SU invoice for external clients).

We're always happy to help out where we can, so even if you're not sure please still get in touch through our
<a href="https://forms.gle/sJ4PSmseBTwrKDK98" target="_blank">Hires
Form</a> or by emailing hires@warwicktechcrew.co.uk. Please contact us as early as possible to ensure equipment and
technician availability.

Please note that all hires and shows are subject to our
