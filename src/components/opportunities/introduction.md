Tech Crew operates over a [hire/show project basis](/wiki/tech-crew/shows-hires), meaning that members apply and
participate in projects. Whilst smaller hires may only require a single member, larger shows often consist of a team of
5+ techies who join a larger production team for the show process. All our roles are advertised on the
[AdamRMS](https://dash.adam-rms.com/) platform and are advertised in Discord and weekly emails. These are then allocated
by the exec after the deadline passes - see the [Crew Assignment Wiki Page](/wiki/tech-crew/shows-hires/crew) for more
information.

In addition to shows and hires, we also regularly run training sessions and socials throughout the year. These are
similarly advertised in the weekly emails and on Discord, and are open to all members. The Discord invite can be found
in any of our emails, which you'll receive after purchasing
[membership](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/techcrew/).
