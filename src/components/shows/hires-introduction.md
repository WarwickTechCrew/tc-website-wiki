In addition to shows, Tech Crew helps with many [wet hires](/hires) throughout the academic year, with a range of
different societies and university departments. This page lists an archive of most of the hires we've worked on (please
note that hires may not be listed if we've only provided equipment or if the hirer has requested not to be).
