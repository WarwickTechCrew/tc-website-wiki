# Shows and Hires

Apart from trainings and socials, all of Tech Crew's activities are divided into shows and hires. These all work on
a project basis, with members applying to roles on each project using our internal system
[AdamRMS](https://dash.adam-rms.com/).

* **Shows** are larger projects in the Warwick Arts Centre with a partnering [drama society](../warwick-drama).
  These are a more standard process with set roles and often require a longer commitment (often a full show week and
  prior planning and meetings).
* **Hires** are projects where a society or group request tech and (a) tech operator(s) for their own event. These
  can be much more varied but are often on a much smaller scale, such as providing a few lights on a stand. These
  are typically a much shorter commitment (e.g. just an evening or weekend) but can be in locations other than the
  Arts Centre.

## Shows

Shows follow a standard process within Warwick Drama, which is documented [here](../warwick-drama/shows). This will
typically consist of joining a show team to write the technical elements of a show **pack** and presenting this at
**panel**. If the show passes panel, the tech team will then plan for the show, communicating with Warwick Arts Centre
through regular meetings and submitting a **technical rider** before show week. Show week then consists of getting into
the space, setting everything up, running a technical and dress rehearsal, completing the show and resetting the venue
for the next event, followed by a debrief.

Examples of shows include Godspell (Music Theatre Warwick), Carmen (Opera Warwick) & The Tempest (Warwick University
Drama Society X ShakeSoc).

## Hires

Hires are any other project we do that isn't a show. These are requested by another society or group through our
**Hires Form**, which the **Hires Manager** manages. Most hires are considered **wet** (as opposed to a *dry* hire),
where the society will ask for operators to run their event. In this case, the opportunity is advertised to our members
who can apply and sign up like for a show.

Examples of hires include PantoSoc pantomimes, The Improv Musical (Music Theatre Warwick) & The Warwick Economics
Summit.

### Special Events

While _technically_ hires, this category contains larger scale events that require an amount of preparation and
involvement closer to shows. They often involve hiring equipment from elsewhere, and are good fun from a tech
perspective without necessarily requiring the huge ongoing time commitment shows can have. Whilst these are the rarest
event that we have in a year, we are hoping that as we partner with more university departments this can become more of
a regular occurrence.

Examples of special invents include [WSAF](../case-studies/wsaf-2024), [Arrivals stage 2024](../06-case-studies/arrivals-2024/index.mdx) and Pride 2023.
