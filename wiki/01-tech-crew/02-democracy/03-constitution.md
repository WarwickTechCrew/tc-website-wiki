   1. Allow the Exec to discuss matters relating to the day-to-day running of the society.
   2. Allow the Exec to vote on issues that require Exec approval.
   3. Allow each member of the Exec to give a brief report of their activities since the last meeting.

2. The President shall chair the Exec meeting and will produce an agenda that will be made available to the other
   members of the Exec ahead of time.

3. The Exec should aim to meet weekly during term time.

   1. This may not always be possible due to show week(s) and other disruptions. Where this is the case, the Exec should
      meet as soon as reasonably practicable.

4. At an Exec meeting, each member is expected to give a brief report of their activities since the last meeting.

5. For an Exec meeting to be quorate, holders of at least four different â€˜electableâ€™ positions (see 1.1) must be
   present.

6. Any matters that require a vote must be voted on at a quorate Exec meeting.

7. For a vote to succeed, it must pass with a simple majority.

   1. Each person who holds an â€˜electableâ€™ role is entitled to an equal vote on any matter.
   2. A person may abstain from voting.
   3. Abstentions have no impact on the quoracy of an exec meeting.
   4. In the event of a tie, the motion being voted on will not pass.

8. All members of the Exec have the right to call an emergency meeting. However, this should only be done when a member
   of the Exec has an issue that needs discussing urgently.

   1. An emergency meeting must be held as soon as possible after being requested.
   2. Unless it is also practical to hold the weekly exec meeting at the same time, the only item on the agenda should
      be the emergency issue that needs to be discussed.
   3. If it is practical to hold the weekly exec meeting at the same time, the emergency issue should be at the top of
      the agenda.

9. In an Exec meeting, the Exec may propose and vote on the creation, alteration, suspension, and abolition of any
   regulatory instrument (including but not limited to: bylaws, regulations, codes of conduct) that addresses any issue
   if all the following are met:
   1. The issue has not been voted on at the most recent General Meeting.
   2. The proposed motion does not contradict this constitution.
   3. The proposed motion does not contradict any SU regulations, bylaws, or codes of conduct.

   1. Technical Manager does not count towards this.

5. An exemption to 8.2-8.4 may be granted in individual cases, but to do so all of the following criteria must be met:

   1. The Welfare Officer must have a discussion with the applicant to ensure they understand the obligations they are
      accepting.
   2. The Equal Opportunities Officer must ensure that granting such an exemption will not unduly deprive other members
      of an opportunity to work on a show.
   3. The Exec must approve an exemption to this restriction by simple majority vote. Should either the Welfare Officer
      or Equal Opportunities Officer vote against the exemption, it will automatically fail, regardless of how other
      Exec members vote.
   4. Should the applicant be the Welfare Officer or Equal Opportunities Officer, their responsibilities under 8.5A-8.5C
      should be carried out by the President.

   considered Core Roles.
