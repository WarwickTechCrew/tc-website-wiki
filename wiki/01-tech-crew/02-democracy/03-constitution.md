   members of the Exec ahead of time.

3. The Exec should aim to meet weekly during term time.

      meet as soon as reasonably practicable.

4. At an Exec meeting, each member is expected to give a brief report of their activities since the last meeting.

5. For an Exec meeting to be quorate, holders of at least four different ‘electable’ positions (see 1.1) must be

   3. Abstentions have no impact on the quoracy of an exec meeting.
   4. In the event of a tie, the motion being voted on will not pass.

   of the Exec has an issue that needs discussing urgently.

   1. An emergency meeting must be held as soon as possible after being requested.
   2. Unless it is also practical to hold the weekly exec meeting at the same time, the only item on the agenda should
      be the emergency issue that needs to be discussed.

      the agenda.

9. In an Exec meeting, the Exec may propose and vote on the creation, alteration, suspension, and abolition of any
   regulatory instrument (including but not limited to: bylaws, regulations, codes of conduct) that addresses any issue
   if all the following are met:
   1. The issue has not been voted on at the most recent General Meeting.
   2. The proposed motion does not contradict this constitution.

   1. The Welfare Officer must have a discussion with the applicant to ensure they understand the obligations they are
      accepting.
   2. The Equal Opportunities Officer must ensure that granting such an exemption will not unduly deprive other members
      of an opportunity to work on a show.
   3. The Exec must approve an exemption to this restriction by simple majority vote. Should either the Welfare Officer
      or Equal Opportunities Officer vote against the exemption, it will automatically fail, regardless of how other
      Exec members vote.
   4. Should the applicant be the Welfare Officer or Equal Opportunities Officer, their responsibilities under 8.5A-8.5C
      should be carried out by the President.
