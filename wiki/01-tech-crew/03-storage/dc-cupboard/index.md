The Drama Collective (DC) Cupboard is our main storage area, located on a balcony in the dock. Whilst we share this
with other societies in Warwick Drama, Tech Crew has its own dedicated area of the space where we keep all of our
equipment.

During a show get-in or get-out the door to this will often be left unlocked. Otherwise, the code to this is only
known by the exec or by the DC Cupboard Manager.
