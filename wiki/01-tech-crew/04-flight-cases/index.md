# Flight Cases

We use flight cases to transport equipment between different venues, and also own a production flight case which is
brought out for shows or large hires.

## Percy (they/she)

Percy is our production flight case, which is stored
[under the stairs leading up to the DC cupboard](/wiki/tech-crew/storage/other-storage#the-under-stairs-cupboard). Percy contains:

* LX tape
* Tools
* Torches and headtorches
* Batteries
* Gobos

## Flo (she/her) and Gibby (he/him)

</div>

Flo and Gibby are two small flight cases which can be used to transport small amounts of equipment or cables. They
aren't massive, but can help for smaller hires or for when Dave is in use. They aren't tall enough to transport the
LVX speakers inside with the lid closing!

Gibby has foam padding inside, but Flo does not!

## Dave [the box] (he/him)
Dave is the main flight case that we use as he is large enough to transport most of what we need but small enough to
fit down the DC cupboard stairs.

In 2024, Dave was used to transport many boxes of pizza to the Introduction to Tech Crew welcome talk.

## Boris (she/they)

Boris should probably be used as a cable trunk for events like WSAF (it would have been so helpful in 2024), however the
primary issue is she doesn't fit down the stairs, so the only way to transport her is by forklift off the edge of the
cupboard, which is not trivial to organise. As such they have remained dormant, taking up space in the cupboard but
being a really convenient movable seat/workbench.

Boris is a cable trunk but has never seen active use with cables. For many years she sat dormant with old 15 and 16amp
cables that were entirely unused, as well as an ominous "needs testing/fixing" cables section. In the 2023 maintenance
week, it was decided that they would be more useful as a generic case for dumping random stuff in, and the dividers were
removed, with the hope of moving it to the [Avon cupboard](/wiki/tech-crew/storage/other-storage#the-avon-cupboard) and
fitting a padlock to it for secure Tech Crew storage there (as there was an expectation that we would be able to use a
forklift on a regular basis).

Uses for Boris:

* Putting cables in
* Putting stuff there isn't another place for in
* Dreaming about being able to use a forklift to use them
* Cutting gels on
* Sitting on
* Getting stuck in a doorway

## Steve (he/him)

Steve is our snake flight case, stored
[under the stairs leading up to the DC cupboard](/wiki/tech-crew/storage/other-storage#the-under-stairs-cupboard). 

He contains:
* 1x 16/8 analogue snake
* 1x 8/0 analogue snake
* 2x Soca
* 2x 15A spiders

Steve was used for late-night snack collection and transportation from Tesco for the 2024 Computing Society WHACK Hire.

## Warwick Arts Centre Flight Cases

During a show in the studio, we also have access to the following flight cases:

* **Big Blue** - sound cables including XLR, 13A, Speakon, Veam
* **Big Orange** - 16a power cables of varying lengths
* **Orange Cube** - DMX cables and ethernet / etherCON

Generally, we use the Art Centre's cables (where available) when working in the WAC.
This leaves cables available for other TC hires that may be happening the same time as a WAC show.
It also helps to avoid mixing up or own cables with theirs during get outs.
The main exception to this is IECs, as these aren't stored in the WAC flight cases.
