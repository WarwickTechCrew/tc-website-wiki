:::info

Please keep the COSHH cupboard tidy and organised according to the [COSHH Guidelines](../03-storage/coshh/index.md).
Please ensure that all paint is sealed so that it can be reused in the future, and wash any brushes etc. thoroughly.

## Tech Crew Stock

The following paints are stocked by Tech Crew:

- **[Leyland Black Matt Emulsion Paint](https://www.diy.com/departments/leyland-trade-black-matt-emulsion-paint-5l/1335267_BQ.prd)**
  (5L) Â£6.00 per litre
- **[Leyland Pure Brilliant White Matt Emulsion Paint](https://www.diy.com/departments/leyland-pure-brilliant-white-matt-emulsion-paint-10l/1335443_BQ.prd)**
  (10L) - Â£2.00 per litre
- **[Flamebar PE6](https://www.flints.co.uk/products/pg_PE6/FLA015)** (5L) (Fabrics & synthetics) - Â£20.00 per litre
  (Heavy/medium fabrics: 4-6mÂ² per litre, light-weight fabrics: 7-9mÂ² per litre)
- **[Flamebar N5](https://www.flints.co.uk/products/pg_N5/FLA012)** (5L) (Wood & wood products) - Â£20.00 per litre
  (Wood: ~4-6mÂ² per litre, paper: ~10mÂ² per litre)

These are purchased on a by-usage basis by measuring the difference on weight of the paint container before and after
use. The cost is calculated by the litre, rounded up to the nearest 0.1L.

If these paints are not stocked in the COSHH cupboard, you can obtain these yourself and charge the cost to Tech Crew.
This should get you paid back through MRF asap, and we'll pass the cost on to the show in the invoce. Tech Crew don't
make profit on this. Please speak to the Exec for more information.

## Other Paints

Other paints may be available in the COSHH cupboard from previous shows and hires, however these are not guaranteed to
be available when it comes to your show.

If the COSHH cupboard contains your paint:

- If the paint container is unopened, Tech Crew will charge the B&Q price or Recommended Retail Price (RRP).
- If the paint container is open, you may use this free of charge.

We request that if you have used paint on a show, you leave this in the COSHH cupboard for future shows to use. Unopened
paint containers can likely be returned to the vendor depending on their return policy.

:::warning

When budgeting, it is best to assume that you will need to purchase paint for your show, even if it currently exists in
the cupboard. There is no guarantee that this paint will remain available as it could be used by another show or thrown
out during maintenance.

## Non-Paint Painting Supplies

Previously-used painting supplies can be reused free of charge providing that these are thoroughly washed after use.

If new painting supplies are required, Tech Crew will charge these on a case-by-case basis depending on their cost in
B&Q or RRP.
