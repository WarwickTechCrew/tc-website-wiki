# Enterprise Car Club Scheme

The [Enterprise Car Club Scheme](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/estates/transport/car_club/) is an initiative by the
Transport & Mobility team which allows staff and PGR students to hire cars on campus for personal (discounted) or
business (free) use.

Warwick SU used to have a free minibus that was available for society and sports club use with the use of a
[University Student Driver's card](https://www.warwicksu.com/news/article/warwicksu/University-Student-Drivers-Card-new-process-for-exec-members/).
This service no longer exists, and the Enterprise Car Club scheme is the closest alternative. Theories for the
discontinuation of the minibus service include a [society](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/13984/)
driving it to Romania and selling the bus there (although this was never confirmed).

## Staff/PGR Business Use (Free)

> The Car Club scheme is available to University Staff and PGR's with access to two fully electric and two hybrid
> vehicles, which can be booked free of charge for business travel only. The cars are supplied and maintained by
> Enterprise Car Club and are permanently parked on campus which can be booked from as little as one hour, up to a
> maximum of two days during weekdays only, full details of the business trip must be provided within the "memo" field
> when booking the vehicle. This is required to validate the booking.

These cars can be booked on an ad-hoc basis, and are often located in the Argent Court car park (next to Tesco). They
can be parked on any general campus car park, but must be returned to the original parking space after use. A campus
electric charge card is provided for electric cars, and a fuel card provided for petrol cars.

As of Jan 2025, if you are below 22 you may only have access to one electric car. Once you reach 22, you will have
access to the whole fleet of four cars.

The above age limit for the fleet was confirmed at 23:17 on Ethan's 22nd birthday.

## Personal Use (Discounted)

> plus many more nationwide, staff and students must register and pay to hire these cars through a separate web portal.
> Please email: TransportFleet@warwick.ac.uk with your name, department and confirmation that you wish to join the Car
> Club scheme for personal travel. We will then supply you with a web link to register to join the scheme. There is
> normally a membership fee of Â£60 to use this service, but the University has negotiated a 100% fee discount for our
> community. If you wish to obtain one year discount on your membership, enter Promo Code WARWICK10. Personal membership
> of Enterprise Car Club provides staff and students with access to hire any of their 1,400 Car Club cars across the UK
