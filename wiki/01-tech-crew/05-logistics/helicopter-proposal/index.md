# Helicopter Proposal 2025

![Concept for helicopter usage during Tech Crew events.](./helicopter-proposal.png)

## Introduction

Warwick Tech Crew frequently faces logistical challenges when transporting equipment, crew, and materials across campus
and beyond. While our current inventory includes high-quality flight cases and trolleys, the process of moving large
amounts of gear remains slow and physically demanding. This proposal outlines the case for acquiring a
[Robinson R44 Raven II helicopter](https://www.europlanesales.com/aircraft-for-sale/robinson-r44-raven-ii-4/) to improve
efficiency, response times, and our ability to manage large-scale productions.

## Current Issues & Justification

- **Equipment Transport:** Large events such as Welcome Week, society balls, and TEDxWarwick require substantial amounts
  of AV and LX gear to be transported across campus. Current methods involve manual handling, which is time-consuming.
- **Crew Mobility:** Rapid response to technical issues is essential, particularly for high-profile productions in
  multiple venues. A helicopter would allow crew members to move between locations far faster than walking or using
  campus buses.
- **Production Scalability:** With increasing demand for hybrid and off-campus events, having aerial transport would
  enable Tech Crew to take on jobs beyond the university, expanding our reach and revenue opportunities.
- **Prestige & Branding:** Warwick Tech Crew would be the first student AV society in the UK (and likely the world) to
  own and operate an aircraft, further establishing our reputation as an industry leader.

## Proposed Solution

The **Robinson R44 Raven II** is a four-seater helicopter offering a balance of affordability, performance, and payload
capacity.

### Key Specifications

- **Capacity:** 4 people (ideal for a pilot and a small AV team)
- **Max Takeoff Weight:** 1,134 kg (according to AdamRMS, this will fit our whole inventory of 1,063.06kg and one person
  of up to 70kg)
- **Cruise Speed:** 109 knots (202 km/h)
- **Range:** ~560 km (allowing for regional event support)
- **Engine:** Lycoming IO-540, 260 HP

With a purchase price of **89,950**, this investment would provide a significant long-term benefit in terms of
logistics, crew efficiency, and event service quality.

## Additional Requirements

- **Pilot Training:** At least one Tech Crew member will need to obtain a Private Pilot’s License (PPL(H)), estimated at
  **£12,000**.
- **Operational Costs:** Fuel, maintenance, and insurance will require additional funding, estimated at **£30,000 per
  year**.
- **Landing Zone & Storage:** We will work with Estates to establish a suitable helipad location and secure storage
  area.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1 – Approval & Funding (2025 Term 2)**
    - Secure SU and university funding.
    - Identify potential sponsors and donors.

2. **Phase 2 – Training & Infrastructure (2025 Term 3)**
    - Enroll selected crew member(s) in pilot training.
    - Work with Estates to establish a helipad.

3. **Phase 3 – Acquisition & Testing (2026 Term 1)**
    - Purchase helicopter and conduct test flights.
    - Develop SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) for crew transport and equipment handling.

4. **Phase 4 – Full Deployment (2026 Term 2)**
    - Integrate the helicopter into standard event logistics.
    - Expand services to external events requiring aerial support.

## Conclusion

The **Robinson R44 Raven II** represents a strategic investment in Warwick Tech Crew’s operational capacity, allowing us
to improve event logistics, reduce transport times, and enhance our technical capabilities. With proper funding,
training, and infrastructure, this purchase will position Tech Crew at the forefront of student event production,
ensuring we continue to innovate and lead the industry.
