# Logistics

## Procurement

:::info
Before purchasing anything, please ensure that this has been approved by the relevant parties (e.g. Tech Crew treasurer,
show production team or respective society treasurer) so that you can be reimbursed. There are also a few
[rules set by the SU](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/exec-resources/finance/guidelines/) to be aware of,
in particular that alcohol cannot be purchased unless a special agreement is made.
:::

When working on a Tech Crew project, it is likely that you will eventually need to order or purchase items. The easiest
way to do this is to pay for the item yourself, retaining the receipt and then submitting a
[Money Request Form](../06-finance/index.md) for later reimbursement (either to Tech Crew or the project's parent
society). It is also possible to use the SU credit card or provide a third party supplier's bank details for direct
payment - please see the [Finance](../06-finance/index.md) page or ask the treasurer for more information.

There are no limitations as to *where* to purchase these items from. We maintain a
[Equipment & Consumable Shop Directory](../../06-directories/03-shops/index.md) of suggested places to purchase common
consumables, however this is not an exhaustive list, nor a requirement.

Note that although the SU are a registered charity, this does not extend to societies. We also must pay VAT - be wary
of many Business-to-Business suppliers excluding this tax (often 20%) on their prices.

When working with university departments, you may hear references to
[University Procurement Services](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/finance/procurement_and_insurance/) or
[approved suppliers](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/finance/procurement_and_insurance/whatisapprovedsupplier/) (note -
this is a staff-only page). As Warwick Students Union is independent to the university, **there is no requirement to
use these** - in fact, it is not uncommon for departments to ask the Students Union to pay for event-production
services or goods on their behalf to bypass this rule.

If required, the following [address](https://www.warwicksu.com/your-union/contact/) can be used (if you're not using
your own):
```
Warwick Tech Crew
Warwick Students’ Union
University of Warwick
Coventry
CV4 7AL
```

## Deliveries

Items can be delivered straight onto campus through the following methods:

* To an Amazon Locker (for small items ordered on Amazon)
* To a University Postroom (for larger items)
* To the Warwick Arts Centre (for larger items which may be more time sensitive)

### Delivering to Campus Amazon Lockers

There are five Amazon lockers on campus, 
[of which Warwick maintains a list here](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/foodgroup/shops/amazon/). This list should be
considered the source of truth over what is listed on Amazon's page.

The most common lockers are:
* **Ivory**: located underneath the Rootes building, next to Benefactors Place.
* **Matson**: located in the Junction car park.

The obvious limitation with using Amazon Lockers is that you must have purchased the item on Amazon, and it must be
delivered/fulfilled by Amazon. Certain items are also not eligible for lockers, such as if they are too large or
contain chemicals or sharp objects.

### Delivering to the University Postroom

As of 2023, the University Postroom is available to all students and staff at Warwick, even if you do not live in
on-campus accommodation. There are multiple collection points, with the closest one often being the
**Westside Postroom** (in the SU) or the **Eastside Postroom** (in the Junction).

This is often a good place to send items to, as long as you can wait a couple of days for them to process and route any
deliveries to the correct collection point. Some collection points also have trolleys that can be temporarily borrowed
in exchange for your Student ID card.

More information and their opening times can be found [on their webpage](https://postroom.warwick.ac.uk/). This page is
also useful to choose your collection point, find the address to use, see the status of all your delivered items
(although this is also sent to the MyWarwick app).

The address will look something like:
```
[Your Name] (student)
[Student ID]
University of Warwick
Coventry
CV4 7ES
```

### Delivering to the Warwick Arts Centre

For Tech Crew projects (especially those for shows within the Warwick Arts Centre), it is also possible for items to be
delivered to the Arts Centre itself. These deliveries will be left at Stage Door or in the Dock. Please be mindful that
the WAC allow us to do this as a kind gesture, so keep it reasonable.

When delivering to the Warwick Arts Centre, use this address:
```
Tech Crew - [Your Name]
Warwick Arts Centre
Gibbet Hill Road
Coventry
CV4 7AL
```

## Vehicles and Parking

Mileage can be claimed if the car is used for society purposes. More information can be found on the
[Finance Page](../06-finance/index.md).

Cars can also be hired for free for business use by staff/PGRs, or at a discounted rate for students/staff/PGRs for
personal use. More information can be found on the [Enterprise Car Club Scheme](./car-scheme.md) page.

### Society Parking Permit
Tech Crew is fortunate to have one car parking space which can be used to support our activities. This can be
transferred to any Exec numberplate by the Tech Crew president on the
[SU Car Parking Management Page](https://warwick.ac.uk/about/campus-journey/car-parking/su/societiesandsports/), under
the following conditions:

* Presidents are the only ones to have access to the form to change number plates.
* If your society drives in an alternative vehicle, the account holder will need to resubmit this form with the updated
  vehicle details, which will remove the existing record and replace it with the new vehicle registration.
* Vehicles can register and park straight away but this cannot be changed again within the next 48 hours, for example,
  if a vehicle is registered at 9:00 on Monday then that individual cannot change the vehicle again until 09:00 on
  Wednesday.
* Parking is restricted to one vehicle and the use of this system is purely for the purpose of the society or sports
  club activities.
* Only exec members can use the permit.


### Society Parking Permit Pool
All societies are also able to book parking permits out of a shared parking permit pool found on
[this webpage](https://warwick.ac.uk/about/campus-journey/car-parking/pool_permits/). This has less restrictions
than the Society Parking Permit and is open to all society members.

### University Vehicle Parking
All university vehicles (such as those on the [Staff/PGR Car Club Scheme](./car-scheme.md)) can park within general
University car parks for free.
