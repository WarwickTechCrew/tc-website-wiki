# Branding

This page contains all branding information and logos for Warwick Tech Crew. You may use our logo and resources when
working with us or promoting our events or activities. If you have any questions or need a different format, please
contact exec@warwicktechcrew.co.uk.

## Colours
We have a very boring colour palette of pure white (#FFFFFF) and black (#000000). Feel free to change this if it suits
your design better, but please keep our logo in its original colours.

## Font
The Tech Crew logo uses a slightly cursed version of <span style={{ fontFamily: '"Century Gothic", sans-serif' }}>
Century Gothic</span>. This website uses a combination of <span class="font-cabin">Cabin</span> for body text, and
<span style={{ fontFamily: '"Segoe UI", sans-serif', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>bold Segoe UI</span> for headings.

## Logo

We have two versions of our logo: one with a black border for light backgrounds, and one with a white border for
dark backgrounds. Please don't modify our logo (excluding resizing it) without asking the exec first at
exec@warwicktechcrew.co.uk.

We've provided the logo in multiple high-quality, transparent and downloadable formats for your convenience. Please use
the SVG format if possible as this can be scaled to any resolution without losing quality.

## Additional Resources

The SU requests that "*all society and sports club promotional material (flyers, posters, digital screen artwork, etc.)
must have the Students’ Union logo displayed on it*" on their
[Exec Resources](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/exec-resources/events/general/).

They provide a zip of their logos on
[their website](https://www.warwicksu.com/pageassets/societies-sports/exec-resources/activities-and-planning/events/warwicksu-logos.zip),
but we also have an SVG of the white Warwick SU logo available
<a href="/icons/warwick-su.svg" target="_blank" download>here</a>.
