# Tech Crew Co-Productions

A Tech Crew Co-Production is a term that refers to when Tech Crew agrees to fund all or some part of a technical
department. This is available to any show with an interesting or unique technical vision, and is decided by the exec on
a case by case basis.

A Tech Crew Co-Production specifically refers to when Tech Crew funds part of a show. This should not be confused with
simply working with or collaborating Tech Crew in general.

:::warning

A Tech Crew Co-Production is **not** free money, and does not change your break-even point. Tech Crew would expect to
see a return of the overall gross revenue proportional to the given capital.

:::

In a co-production:

- Tech Crew will fund all or some part of a department as per a contract agreed on by the show team and Tech Crew exec.
- Tech Crew will expect a return of the overall gross revenue corresponding to how much capital they have given against
  the overall show budget. For example, if a show costs ¬£12,000 to produce and Tech Crew funds ¬£3,000 (25%), Tech Crew
  expects 25% of the overall gross revenue:
  - If the show breaks even with ¬£12,000 of revenue, Tech Crew expects ¬£3,000 and the remaining ¬£9,000 would be split
    amongst other parties in the co-production.
  - If the show loses ¬£6,000 with ¬£6,000 of revenue, Tech Crew expects ¬£1,500 and the remaining ¬£4,500 would be split
    amongst other parties in the co-production.
  - If the show makes ¬£18,000 with ¬£18,000 of revenue, Tech Crew expects ¬£4,500 and the remaining ¬£13,500 would be split
    amongst other parties in the co-production.
- Tech Crew designers have a final say on any elements of their funded department aligning with the overall vision of
  the show. This includes the final say over directors/producers.
- All show advertising must include the Tech Crew logo and mention that the show is being produced in collaboration with
  Tech Crew.

A co-production will only be agreed to if the technical vision is interesting or unique, and will give the opportunity
for Tech Crew members to work on something new. This could include extensive set electronics, full set video projection,
a rotating set, etc.

Note that for a co-production to take place, there must be a clear and detailed technical vision and accurate budget. It
is therefore only possible to apply for this once a tech team has been assigned.

Key Terms:

- **Break-Even Point**: The percentage of ticket sales that need to be made to cover the costs of a show before it
  starts to generate a profit. A show should generally aim to have a break-even of up to 65%.
- **Capital**: The money that Tech Crew has put forward in the co-production.
- **Gross Revenue**: The total revenue the show has generated (including ticket and programme sales) before any expenses
  are taken off.

## Proposing a Co-Production

A Tech Crew Co-Production can be proposed by the show production or technical team by emailing the Tech Crew exec at
[exec@warwicktechcrew.co.uk](mailto:exec@warwicktechcrew.co.uk). This should include:

- What you want funding for - i.e. which department(s) and/or for what equipment.
- Why this warrants a collaboration - i.e. how this is interesting or unique.
- How this is integral for the show.
- A detailed (as accurate as possible) budget - this should e.g. be fully quoted.

The Tech Crew will then discuss this in the next exec meeting and get back to you with a decision. As meetings often
only happen once a week (and may already be full of agenda items), this can take some time.
