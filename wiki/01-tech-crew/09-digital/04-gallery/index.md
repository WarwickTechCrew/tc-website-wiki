# Warwick Drama Photo Archive

The [Warwick Drama Photo Archive](https://gallery.warwickdrama.org.uk/) is a collection of photos from shows and events
run by Warwick Drama societies and Tech Crew. It runs on the [Piwigo](https://piwigo.org/) platform, hosted by the
[University of Warwick Computing Society](https://uwcs.co.uk/), and is maintained by Tech Crew.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to upload photos to the archive - we aim to have a complete record of all shows
across the [archive](https://gallery.warwickdrama.org.uk/) and our [shows page](/shows).

To upload photos, you will first need an account. This can be requested from a Warwick Drama Photo Archive maintainer
or a Tech Crew exec member.
