# Tech Crew

Tech Crew is one of the many [Warwick SU Societies](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/techcrew/),
with a purpose of providing technical theatre training and opportunities for students at the University of Warwick.

Apart from socials and trainings, most of our activity is determined other groups and societies (especially those in
[Warwick Drama](/wiki/warwick-drama)) who require technical support for their
[shows and events](/wiki/tech-crew/shows-hires). This provides quite a lot of flexibility and variety in the work that
we do, with members being able to get involved with as much or as little as they wish.

As per our [constitution](https://www.warwicksu.com/resources/techcrew/Tech-Crew-Constitution/), our aims and objectives
are:

1. To provide our members with opportunities to manage, design, and operate the technical equipment for shows,
   productions, and other performance events.
2. To provide our members with opportunities to develop their technical skills through the provision of workshops,
   training sessions, and shadowing.
3. To work with other Warwick SU societies, providing them with guidance and support in the production of their events.
4. To advise prospective production teams that are submitting a pack on the technical aspects of their proposals, and
   how their artistic vision can feasibly be achieved.
5. To scrutinise packs submitted to a panel for any Warwick SU society .
6. To maintain a supply of specialist technical equipment which, for a nominal fee, may be hired out, subject to terms
   and conditions.
