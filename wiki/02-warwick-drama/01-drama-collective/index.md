The [Drama Collective (DC)](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/dramacollective/) is a society that was
formed to be a larger negotiating body for its constituent societies. For example:

- [WAC allocates 2 show slots](../warwick-drama/shows#wac-show-slots) to the DC each term. Without the DC, none of the
  constituent societies would have the resources to put on 2 shows a term themselves. The DC production manager runs a
  panel for each of these slots. Show teams can submit packs to DC panel, once they get backing from one of the DC
  societies.
- The DC also provide "cupboard manager" exec roles to organise and upkeep its two storage locations, the
  [DC cupboard](../tech-crew/storage/dc-cupboard) in WAC, and the
  [Avon cupboard](../tech-crew/storage/other-storage#the-avon-cupboard).
- The DC has a
  [constitution](https://www.warwicksu.com/resources/dramacollective/Drama-Collective-Constitution-updated-2023/) that
  all its societies are meant to follow.
- The DC often put on a joint ball at the end of the year, in term 3.

If you have Tech Crew membership (or membership of any of its other child societies), you are automatically a member of
the DC and can officially join on the
[SU website](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/dramacollective/) for free! This is useful to be able
to vote for or against DC motions.

## [Codpiece](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/codpiecetheatre/)

Codpiece is the "devised theatre" society at Warwick. Devised theatre is when the script originates not from a writer,
but from collaborative, often improvisatory, work by the performers themselves.

## [Shakesoc](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/shakespeare/)

Shakespeare society joined the DC in the academic year 22/23, through an AGM motion in the DC Annual General Meeting.

## [WUDS](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/wuds/)

Warwick University Drama Society focuses on performing established published plays.

## [WUPS](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/freshbloodtheatre/)

Formerly known as Freshblood New Writing Society (before their 2025 AGM), Warwick University Playwriting Society specialise in performing student written shows. They run Freshblood Festival, showcasing short, student-written plays. They also run FreshFund, to provide support to new scripts and bring warwick written shows to life. As of writing, their change from Freshblood to WUPS is still in progress, and both may be found across their social media.

## [Tech Crew](https://www.warwicksu.com/societies-sports/societies/techcrew/)

Tech crew has a [wiki](../) you should check out :D

As of 2024, they also put on the [Warwick Student Arts Festival](/wiki/case-studies/wsaf-2024), although this may be
made into its own society in future years.
