Your show has been accepted - now what? It's now time to properly start preparing for the show...

During this stage, Tech Crew may assign additional members to the show if necessary or if roles were not filled
pre-panel. These are often smaller non-designer or assistant roles such as Deputy Stage Manager (DSM), followspot
operators and sound assistants (sound 2s).

## Tech Read-Through

This is the initial sit-down meeting between the production team and the tech. It involves going through the script page
by page, penciling in each place the prod team would like a cue. This will probably be the first time you get your
script, exiting! The meeting usually involves the designers and core prod team, so: LX designer, Sound designer,
Technical Manager, Producers, Director, and optionally: Music director, Video designer, DSM, etc.

## Rehearsals

As the show gets closer, you'll want to start attending rehearsals - this is generally useful for all roles, but is most
important for the Deputy Stage Manager (DSM) so they understand the script well. This is a great way to get a feel for
the show and what is suitable when. For the lighting department, this can also be useful to see the actor blocking.

Before show week, most tech members should have attended at least one full run-through.

### Sitzprobe

This is the first rehearsal where the band or orchestra perform with the actors. It's highly encouraged that the sound
designer attend this rehearsal!
