Your show has been accepted - now what? It's now time to properly start preparing for the show...

During this stage, Tech Crew may assign additional members to the show if necessary or if roles were not filled
pre-panel. These are often smaller non-designer or assistant roles such as Deputy Stage Manager (DSM), followspot 
operators and sound assistants (sound 2s).

## Staging type

The prod team will decide what staging they wish their play to be in.
Staging refers to where the audience are positioned relative to the performance area.
There are four main types of staging:

| Staging Type | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| **End on**   | The most common type of staging, where the audience sit on one half of the room with the performers directly opposite. This is the only staging type we can do in the WAC theatre, and the most common to see in the studio. |
| **Traverse** | When audience are on two opposite sides of the stage (like a fashion runway/catwalk). |
| **Thrust**   | Where the audience sits on three sides of the stage, looking in. Often done in the studio by adding two rows of chairs on steeldeck either side of the stage, with the bleachers out. Be careful doing shows in the thrust! Attention should be paid to sightlines and the actors' blocking. |
| **Round**    | Where there is seating on all sides of the stage, with the audience looking in. |


## Tech Read-Through
This is the initial sit-down meeting between the production team and the tech. It involves going through the script
page by page, penciling in each place the prod team would like a cue. This will probably be the first time you get your
script, exiting! The meeting usually involves the designers and core prod team, so: LX designer, Sound designer,
Technical Manager, Producers, Director, and optionally: Music director, Video designer, DSM, etc.

## Rehearsals

As the show gets closer, you'll want to start attending rehearsals - this is generally useful for all roles, but is 
most important for the Deputy Stage Manager (DSM) so they understand the script well. This is a great way to get a feel 
for the show and what is suitable when. For the lighting department, this can also be useful to see the actor blocking.

Before show week, most tech members should have attended at least one full run-through.

### Sitzprobe

This is the first rehearsal where the band or orchestra perform with the actors.
It's highly encouraged that the sound designer attend this rehearsal!

## Paper Tech
The paper tech will normally take place on the weekend before show week, and is where the tech team runs through the

first time.
