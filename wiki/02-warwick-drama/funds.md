# Funds

Performances which happen outside of the WAC – They usually take place in the FAB, Avon, or Millburn. Prod teams are given a small amount of money with which to create this show and they often (but not always) have free tickets.

Societies in the Drama Collective usually have 1 of these per term. These go through Pack & Panel the same as a show but without WAC representatives. As stated under [Shows and Hires](https://www.warwicktechcrew.co.uk/wiki/tech-crew/shows-hires), any Tech Crew involvement in these performances is considered a hire.

In addition to the termly Fund slots of the DC societies, there are other kinds of productions throughout Warwick Drama all year that don't fall under the 'Fund' umbrella. Considering many of these opportunities are non-traditional, some (such as the Weekend Shows) may have little to no tech.

## WUDS
- Freshers Play – Put on in Term 1, where all cast and prod team are freshers as a useful introduction into the Warwick Drama process. Producer and Director teams all put forward packs for the same exec-chosen play.
- WUDS in the Woods – A Shakespeare play performed outside in Term 3! Despite its name, ‘WUDS in the Woods’ is a collaboration between WUDS and Shakesoc. 

## Shakesoc
- Will In a Week - A script based on/inspired by anything and everything to do with Shakespeare’s plays, that is rehearsed and put on in one week.

## Freshblood
- Freshblood Festival (FreshFest) - Showcases a number of shorter, student-written scripts, produced by individual production teams and performed over the festival weekend.

## Codpiece
- Shoal-y Not - Codpiece's weekend shows that are devised, rehearsed, and put together in 48 hours, often to fun and chaotic results.

## MTW

- Weekend Show - Exclusive to MTW Freshers and usually a parody/knock-off of an existing musical that auditions, rehearses, and performs within a weekend. 
- Spotlight - Performance slot for a musical with less than 5 characters. It's panelled late Term 3 and performs early Term 1.
- The Week Where It Happens - Like the weekend show, except a period of 7 days instead, and open to all members.
  
The following opportunities run as part of Stagefest (now part of WSAF). These productions run without a budget and do not sell tickets. 

- New Writing - For a newly created musical written by a student
- Revue - Musical adaptation (created by a student) of another pre-existing form of media
- Freshers Musical - A ‘knock off’ version of a pre-existing musical with the adaptation written by students and the entire cast and prod team being MTW freshers
