# Cans, Comms and Cuelights

## Cans / Comms

Cans refer to two-way headsets used for backstage communication during shows and events and differ from traditional
radios in that they are duplex (i.e. multiple people can speak at the same time) and
have low latency. The brand most commonly used
(and which is used by Tech Crew and the Warwick Arts Centre)
is [Canford](https://www.canford.co.uk/Tecpro-communication-system).

There are two types of cans: wired and wireless. Wired cans are connected via XLR sound cables to a base station, and
can be daisy-chained. Wireless cans allow for more freedom of movement (so may be beneficial for the stage department
or for light focusing during a get-in) and also give a few additional features such as the possibility for more
channels/private conversations.

Tech Crew owns a cans base station and a number of wired cans and headphones, however do not own any wireless cans
systems. The Warwick Arts Centre studio and theatre are both equipped with wireless cans, which can be requested from
your WAC duty technician (note that this is chargeable). Note that in the WAC, wired (i.e. patch panel) and wireless
cans all run on the same circuit so are interoperable.

:::note
The Tech Crew base station and Warwick Arts Centre cans systems have two circuits: A and B. These are completely
separate from each other, so make sure that you plug into the same one on each patch panel!

## Cuelights

Cuelights are similar to cans, except work with a light and button rather than through a headset. These are typically
used when headsets would be impractical - such as for a Musical Director (MD), sound operator doing live mixing or for
the cast in the wings.

:::tip
Sometimes it's worth giving people both cans and a cuelight - for example, a sound operator may be mainly cued using a
cuelight, however may also need to speak using cans to fix any issues or speak to a sound assistant during a show.
:::

Tech Crew do not own any cuelights, however these can be used free of charge whenever working in the Warwick Arts
Centre studio or theatre.

Cuelights are connected via XLR sound cables to a patch panel, similar to wired cans. Each cuelight will have a number
which corresponds to a number on the DSM Desk. The DSM Desk can then be used to put each cuelight on standby or to
send a 'GO' signal.
