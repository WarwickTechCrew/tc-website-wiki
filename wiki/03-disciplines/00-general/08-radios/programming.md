# Radio Programming

:::info
Generally, you shouldn't need to program the radios yourself. This can be a massive pain and take a long time to do.
The software is also very buggy and only compatible with Windows.

If you can avoid programming them, then probably do so.

Tech Crew have copies of all programming software mentioned below. Please contact a member of the TechXec if you need
access.

## [Customer Programming Software (CPS)](https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/products/two-way-radios/commercial-business-two-way-radio-systems/business-radio-software.html)

CPS is the official software provided by Motorola to program their radios on a small scale, and is the easiest way to
program them.

## Radio Management Fleet Software

For large scale programming, there is a larger fleet of software provided by Motorola which supports programming many
radios at the same time using Over the Air (OTAP) programming - this means that only one radio needs to be connected
to the computer, and the rest can be programmed wirelessly.

However, this is more complicated to run as it requires running several pieces of software and a database.
