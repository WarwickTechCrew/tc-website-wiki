# Gels & Gobos

## Gels

Gels are thin transparent coloured film that are placed in front of a light source to colour the light. You'll need to
find the LX cutting board (it has useful size guides) and a stanley knife to cut these into squares for your lights.

Gels are also used by sound designers! The [RAT music stands](https://www.ratstands.com/product/shop-opera-stand/)
(music stands with lights) are often too bright, so we gel them with a light blue colour. This makes their appearance
less harsh while still allowing musicians to read their sheet music.

# Gobos

Gobos are thin metal plates with designs cut into them. They are put in front of spotlights to project that image onto
the set.
