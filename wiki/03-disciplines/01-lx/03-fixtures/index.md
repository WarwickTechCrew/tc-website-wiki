# Fixtures

## Generics

Usually tungsten-halogen lights. They don't have a DMX input, so a dimmer rack is used to send them different amounts of
power to control their brightness. You can use gels, gobos and their shutters to control the light. Used for general
illumination.

## Intelligent Lights

Lights that can be controlled by DMX, and powered through powercon or IEC. For example, LED's where you can control the
colour, or movers where you can control the position, through DMX.

## COB

COB (Chip on Board) lights, LEDs that are supposed to mimic the optical characteristics of a parcan. Tech crew own
[Prolights StudioCob FC](https://www.prolights.it/en/product/STUDIOCOBFC), which only have RGB chips so make a pretty
bad white but excellent big bold colours.

## PAR

PAR (parabolic aluminized reflector) lights have a reflector, lens and light source (either filament or LED) all in one
fixture. Tech crew own [Prolights LumiPar 12HPro](https://www.prolights.it/en/product/LUMIPAR12HPRO), which have
RGBWA+UV chips (Red, Green, Blue, White, Amber, UV). This means our PARs can make nice white colours.

## Birdies

These are small generics often used for lighting walkways backstage. Called birdies because "they are one under par".

## Batten

Equinox RGB Power Batten.

## Ghibli

[Ayrton's](https://www.ayrton.eu/produit/ghibli/) brand of moving head light. Also a great movie studio.

## Specials

Can be either generic or intelligent, specials are often focused on highlighting a particular area.
