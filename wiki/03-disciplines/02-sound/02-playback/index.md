# Sound Playback

Sound playback is the process of playing audio or sound effects during shows. For Tech Crew shows, this is often done
using [QLab](https://qlab.app/), of which the Tech Crew Macbook has a QLab 4 audio license.

## Sound Effects (SFX)

Sound effects are often used in shows to make the show more realistic or create an atmosphere. They may also be linked
or interacted with by the cast, such as phone or doorbell sound effects.

# Music

Generally, any music should be downloaded locally in advance and played from the Tech Crew Macbook using QLab, along
with any other SFX.

Whilst it is possible to use Spotify for music playback, this is technically against the
[Spotify Terms of Use](https://www.spotify.com/uk/legal/end-user-agreement/) which only allows personal, non-commercial
use.

Spotify offer a service called [Soundtrack Your Brand](https://www.soundtrackyourbrand.com/) which can be used
commercially - the university has a few old iPhones with licenses for this service, which can be requested when working
with them on larger projects (such as the [Christmas Lights Switch-on](/wiki/case-studies/christmas-lights)).

### WAC Music Licensing
When working in the Warwick Arts Centre, we can use their license which allows music playback during the start/end of
shows and intervals for free. Songs which are played during the show (or which are interacted with by cast) may
require separate royalties, which are handled by the Arts Centre.

This is generally handled by the Arts Centre technicians in the meetings before the show.
