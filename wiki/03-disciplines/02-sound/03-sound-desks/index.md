# Sound Desks

We currently own 5 sound desks! The SQ5, DM12, E12, Si Expression 3, and the O1V96. This page also talks about the
DiGiCo S21 which is used in WAC and FAB, and the Gilded Balloon's LS9.

## Allen&Heath SQ5

![Picture of the SQ5 with barry the baugette](./sq5-baguette-kishansharma.jpg)

This is the fanciest and newest sound desk that Tech Crew own! Bought in January 2023, it's a digital mixing desk that
can handle 48 channels, 16 preamps and 12 line outputs. The tech crew iPad can be used to
[mix this desk remotely](/wiki/disciplines/general/networking#sq5-audio-mixer) while walking around the venue. The desk
has dedicated knobs for all processing which makes it quick to navigate and use during live mixing. This is the desk we
use for all substantial sound activities outside of WAC! You can use this for WAC shows too if you (like me) prefer it
over an S21.

:::warning

Our SQ5 does not yet have a Dante expansion card! So you'll need to stick to USB input for playback, or use the WAC's
S21 instead.

## DiGiCo S21

![Digico S21](./carmen-2024-mascot.jpg)

This is the digital sound desk found all over WAC and FAB. 48 channels, 16 onboard preamps, 12 outputs. It has maximal
touchscreen minimal physical buttons/knobs. Supposedly more beginner friendly, with the touchscreens having nicer
diagrams for how audio is being routed about the desk. You can request to use one with a Dante card from WAC. See its
[datasheet](https://digico.biz/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DiGiCo-S21-Data-Sheet-1.pdf)! Note that this desk gets a bit
laggy if you cram too many scenes into it (you know who you are). Would recommend looking into TheatreMix if you want to
mix on DCA's during a show! It is suspected WAC and FAB own about 12 of these sound desks. WAC also own an S31, which
just has more faders if you need (but the same I/O).

:::warning

Although this desk can handle a maximum of 48 stereo channels and an infinite amount of scenes, DO NOT use hundreds of scenes.
The last time someone pushed the desk by using over 200 scenes, it became an unresponsive laggy mess and was incredibly painful to use.

:::lore

The area of campus encompassing WAC and the FAB has 378 DigiCo S21s per square km.

## Midas Pro2

![Midas Pro2 sound desk](./midas-pro2-joshheng.jpg)

This is another desk that WAC owns and uses occasionally.
It is a large digital mixing console that was commonly used in professional touring and large-scale
performance venues.
It was designed to mainly function as a monitor mixing desk but can also be used as a main FOH desk.
It  accommodates up to 64 input channels, accompanied by a full 8x8 matrix.
The console‚Äôs semi-modular construction allows for extensive local I/O that can expand through external stage boxes connected via AES50, making it well suited to big events requiring numerous channels and flexible placement of inputs.
The Pro2 also includes robust automation and scene recall features that make quick transitions during complex productions feasible.
While it is physically larger and heavier than many smaller desks, its advanced processing power, refined audio quality, and comprehensive control surface justify the size when used inconcerts or shows demanding first-rate audio control.
It has quite a complicated UI that does take time to get used to, but allows almost infinite customisability.
The built in effects are fantastic and easily out perform those included in modern, high end theatre consoles.
This desk also has native support for a separate mono bus, mixing in LCRS (Left, Centre, Right, and Surround) and mixing in full 5.1 surround sound (Left, Right, Centre, Subwoofer, Left surround, and Right surround).
Although this desk is showing its age (such as no native support for USB audio or Dante networking), it is still a very competent desk.

## Midas DM12

![Midas DM12 sound desk](./midas-dm12-kishansharma.jpg)

One of the two analogue sound desks we own!

8 Mono XLR inputs, 2 Stereo jack inputs, 2 Auxes and a Main LR out. This is a lovely little desk, its super lightweight
and portable with a minimal layout. This desk has two insert slots which can supposedly be used for an outboard FX rack,
however you need some special jack-jack splitter for the input and output that I couldn't work out. The approach that
worked for me was sending channels to the outboard FX using one of the auxes, then taking the FX return back into the
desk through one of the stereo input channels (green fader). ~~Sadly the channel 6 fader cap has despawned :(~~ It has
respawned albeit looking slightly different!

## Soundcraft Spirit E12

![Soundcraft Spirit E12](./soundcraft-spirit-e12-kishansharma.jpg)

Our second analogue desk, with four more inputs than the DM12. The main LR on this desk has a scale from 0 to -infinity
(instead of the normal design of +10 to -infinity), this doesn't affect anything in a meaningful way... but I guess
that's something to say about this desk.

## Soundcraft Si Expression 3

![Soundcraft Si expression 3](./si-expression-3-kishansharma.jpg)

This desk has the most onboard preamps (32!) out of all the desks we own. It also has super cool RGB backlit faders. The
fader colour represents what type each channel is (Group, DCA, FX etc). However, the flightcase is pretty massive and
its heavy, please don't try unpack this desk on your own! (speaking from experience..) Its also the only desk we own
that still has its dust cover lol.

:::lore

This desk is called Sibyl! We are trying to sell Sibyl. They take up too much space in the cupboard! and are not very
practical to use compared to the SQ5 :(

## Yamaha O1V96

![Yamaha O1V96 sound desk](./yamaha-O1V96-kishansharma.jpg)

This desk has a little LCD digital display. This desk is in the middleground between our more powerful digital SQ5, and
our simpler analogue desks. We keep this desk around for training as it is similar to the LS9.

## Yamaha LS9

![Yamaha LS9](./LS9-fringe-joshheng.jpg)

This is the sound desk installed in the Gilded Balloon's Big Yin, the MTW Improv Musical's fringe venue for the last few
years (as of 24/25). We don't own one of these, so we have used our O1V96 to practice for fringe mixing, given its
similarity (same manufacturer) to the LS9. See how the tape colours correspond to the performers teeshirt colour!

## Glossary

### Channels

The number of _channels_ in a sound desk represents the number of simultaneous inputs that the desk can process at a
time. For example a 48 channel desk could handle 12 cast radiomics + 8 drum mics + 14 orchestra mics + 2 offstage mics +
4 boundary mics + 5 FX groups + 2 playback channels + 1 god mic, channels get used up fast!

### Preamps

The number of _preamps_ on a desk/stagebox is the number of weak, unamplified, "mic-level" signals (such as the signal
from a normal microphone) that the desk/stagebox can lift up to a "line-level" signal suitable to be processed by a
desk.

:::note

The number of preamps on a digital desk is normally much lower than the total number of channels a desk can handle! For
example, once you've used up the 16 SQ5 onboard preamps, you'll have to find other ways (stagebox's preamp, soundcard,
etc) to provide line level signal to the remaining 32 channels.

:::

:::info

The signal from a microphone is produced by movement in a tiny diaphragm that vibrates due to the sound pressure waves
from the source. This signal is weak and contains background noise, it isn't able to unable to undergo processing (fx,
compression etc) from a sound desk unless it is first brought up to a higher amplitude by a preamp.
