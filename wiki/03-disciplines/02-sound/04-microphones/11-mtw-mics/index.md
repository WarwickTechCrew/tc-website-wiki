In musical theatre, it's often the case that every instrument needs to be micced to ensure the mix sounds accurate to the original music.
This is a guide of which mics to use for which instruments.

|                    Mic                    |                                When to use                               |               Does TC own?               |                                                                                                                    Notes                                                                                                                    |   |
|:-----------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|---|
| Radio Mics                                | Principle cast / Singing volume                                          | Yes - 16* (*on a good day)               | RMs are expensive but can be used on secondary/ensemble cast if budget allows.                                                                                                                                                              |   |
| AKG PCC160 (With foam)                    | Ensemble cast / Talking volume                                           | No                                       | Boundary mic that has a very high pickup. 2-3 can cover the entire WAC theatre.  Comes with a small piece of foam that it should be placed on to avoid picking up shoe sounds. Has an arrow on the bottom to show where sound is picked up. |   |
| AKG PCC160 (Without foam)                 | Tap dancing                                                              | No                                       | As above for ensemble. Don‚Äôt use the foam if you want shoe sounds to be picked up.                                                                                                                                                          |   |

This is useful in a small space like Avon where you would want to mute the amp and control all monitoring from the sound desk.                                   |   |
| Stereo DI                                 | For instruments with L-R DI (mostly keyboards)                           | Yes - 1                                  | One of the jack outs on the MTW keyboard has a lot of static noise so use mono for this.                                                                                                                                                    |   |
