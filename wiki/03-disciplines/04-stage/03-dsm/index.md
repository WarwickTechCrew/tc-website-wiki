The Deputy Stage Manager:
* Is in charge of running the show and should be aware of all cues.
* Is heavily involved in the tech run, calling cues and adjusting them as required.
* Communicates with the tech team via 'cans' headsets.
* Times the show
* Attends the [paper tech](/wiki/warwick-drama/shows/show-preparation#paper-tech), where they will go over the cues from
  each department.
* Needs to be familiar with the script so they can 'fix the show' if things go wrong (e.g. cast missing lines).

:::info
Information about a DSM's responsibilities throughout the show process can be found on the
[Shows](/wiki/warwick-drama/shows) pages.

## DSM Calls

Calls refer to PA announcements made by the DSM (or another technician such as the TM in lieu of a DSM). These are made
to either Front of House (FOH) (all public areas in the WAC, including the toilets and just outside) or Back of House
(BOH) (all backstage areas including corridors, dressing room and toilets).

In general, calls should be repeated twice and should end with *'thank you'*. Calls to BoH should start with *"For the
attention of the [SHOW] company"*. Back of House calls are always 5 minutes ahead of actual time - e.g. the 'half'
call is given 35 minutes before the show is supposed to open, not half an hour.

:::note
The following calls are just an example, modified from the calls given for MTW Company, 2024 (Jon K) (a Music
Theatre Warwick show in the theatre).

## Requesting Clearance

Once the show is supposed to open (either at the start or after an interval), the DSM should request clearance from
Front of House to start the show. There are two main methods to do this, which should be determined with the WAC
duty-technician before the show starts.

* **Cue Lights**: Once the show is ready to start, the DSM can cue the FoH cue light on their prompt desk. FoH will then
  click the 'standby' button on their light, after which the DSM can click 'go' and start the show.
* **Radio**: The WAC duty technician will be in the control room at the show start and will be able to radio FoH for
  clearance.
