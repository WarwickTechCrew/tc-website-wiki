# (Stage) Management

Management for Warwick shows are typically divided into four main roles:

- **Technical Manager (TM)**: Responsible for making sure everyone in the tech team is on top of their jobs, and for
  overall communication with the production team and WAC. Also responsible for managing the get-in and get-outs and
  ensuring that show week is kept to schedule as much as possible.
- **Stage Manager (SM)**: Responsible for managing the stage and cast during the show.
- **Deputy Stage Manager (DSM)**: Responsible for running ('calling') the show and calling cues to the tech team.
- **Assistant Stage Managers (ASMs)**: Responsible for helping the SM manage the stage, such as helping with scene
  changes during the show. Often recruited much closer to the show, with less prior preparation.
