# FAB

Both studios come equipped with and ETC Ion Xe 20, a DiGiCo S21 and a Mac with QLab5.

Note that the colour on the Mini-Bs is inconsistent between the fixtures as they are set with different dimming curves.
This can be changed using non-RDM DMX though (consult DMX personality document), so could be fixed easily.
