# Piazza / Benefactors Place

The Piazza is the outdoor space in front of the Rootes Building, and Benefactors Place is the area next to it with the
Wednesday food trucks. This is a much rarer space than the other indoor ones, however is a popular spot for larger
events or festivals with the budget of an outdoor stage.

## Piazza Map

The following map shows the available power ducts and the closest networking points. If access to the network is
required, [Warwick IT Services](/wiki/directories/services#it-services) will need to be contacted in advance.

## Stage

The stage can be very variable, often being rented by the group hosting the event and not Tech Crew. For Warwick
Presents, this is usually the [ST30 Trailer Stage](https://www.stagetecheventhire.co.uk/small-trailer-stage.html) or
[ST60 Trailer Stage](https://www.stagetecheventhire.co.uk/st-48-medium-trailer-stage.html). These come in on a large
truck and are put up by an external company, however they can generally help with rigging to truss and providing a
ladder if Tech Crew is also present.

Sometimes, Tech Crew also has access to the Warwick Presents Gazebos which can be used as a tech tent - if this is the
case, it's important to make sure that any cables from the stage to the tech tent are properly covered with cable ramps.
Otherwise, the other option is to place the tech desk at the back of the stage itself, ensuring that it is covered from
the weather. Both the SQ5 (sound) and FLX (LX) can be accessed remotely using a WiFi network.

## Power

The Piazza has two 13A power outlets near curiositea. There are also various 16A outlets next to the wall in the Piazza
and in the floor on Benefactors Place, with larger 63A 3-phase supplies also available in the distribution boxes (see
map).

Tech Crew only has a limited number of equipment to handle 16A to 13A conversion, and does not have any equipment for
63A - so you'll need to hire this from an external company, the
[SU](/wiki/directories/services#warwick-su-tech-services) or [Estates](/wiki/directories/services#estates).

## Overnight Security

If leaving equipment out overnight, security is a large concern. Typically everything should be packed away each night
and secured indoors, unless rigged high out of reach. Another option is to have someone there awake 24/7, but that can
be difficult to arrange.

Community Safety can sometimes provide overnight security for a surcharge of around Â£16-20 hour, depending on
availability.

## Networking

Whilst the Piazza has default Wi-Fi coverage, getting a wired connection is much more difficult. The nearest network
ports are in the Big Screen AV cupboard, or on any of the lamp posts with CCTV - but these aren't close to most ideal
stage locations, or require crossing roads.

Whilst there is underground ducting under most of the Piazza (used already for power distribution), IT Services
estimates that adding network cabling would cost above Â£500 due to needing to get contractors to put it in and take it
out.

## Tables and Chairs

Another thing to consider when outside is the need for tables and chairs, as these aren't as accessible. The
[SU Operations team](/wiki/directories/services#warwick-su-operations) can sometimes help with this if enough notice is
provided, however these are also used for POP and circling so should be wiped down before use.

## Food Market

The Piazza holds a food market every Wednesday, organised by the Warwick Food Group. Most large events can therefore not
take place on Wednesday, and in 2024 the WSAF/Warwick Presents stage had to be packed down and moved to a close-by car
park during this time.

It is also not permitted to serve food to the public on the Piazza (without prior advance agreement), likely because it
can decrease Warwick Food Group sales.
