# Junction Building

The Junction Building is the old University of Warwick Sports Centre which has since been repurposed into an exams venue
and space for [Warwick Innovation Group](https://warwickinnovationdistrict.com/). There are still certain areas, most
notably the empty and collapsed-roof swimming pool, which are not accessible to students or staff.

There are two large events spaces within junction: Junction Hall 1 (JX0.03) and Junction Hall 2 (JX0.10), both
of which are bookable as [Centrally Timetabled Rooms](/wiki/spaces/ctr).

:::lore
Work is being done in these spaces over Summer 2025 to make them suitable for lectures. Planned works include
collapsible auditorium seating and new AV systems.

This hall is located at the front of the building. In 2024, it was used as the venue for the
[Warwick Hackathon (WHACK)](https://warwickhack.co.uk/), resulting in the installation of a dedicated 63-3A power
supply in one of the side storage cupboards.

A floorplan that was used for the WHACK 2024 Hackathon can be found below:

One of the fire exits leads to a small outdoor car park, which is very beneficial for loading. This car park has been
used as a marquee location for [Warwick CU's Hope Events Week](https://warwickcu.org/hope-2025/) in 2025.

### The Hope Hole

The hope hole refers to a hole in the wall of Junction Hall 1, next to one of the fire exits, which was created to
supply heavy duty power from Junction Hall 1's 63-3A supply to an outdoor marquee for
[Warwick CU's Hope Events Week](https://warwickcu.org/hope-2025/) in 2025. This also came in useful for supplying a
wired network connection to the marquee for livestreaming.

## [Junction Hall 2 (JX0.10)](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8927421e6f5928c0ef7a?projectId=warwick)

:::warning
