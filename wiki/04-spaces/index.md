# Spaces

These are the venues we normally work in!

WAC Studio and Theatre are hired out for use by the DC, MTW, and OpWa, see:
[the wiki page about WAC show slots](warwick-drama/shows#wac-show-slots). The WAC venue hire fee takes up a large
portion of the show budget! So, for smaller independent shows, and for our hires, we use venues around Warwick outside
of WAC.

A list of campus venues for specialist events (e.g. performance) can be found on the
[Central Timetabling Alternative Venues Website](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/academicoffice/centraltimetabling/roominformation/alternativevenues).
