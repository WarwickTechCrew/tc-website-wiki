# MTW Improv in Avon

## Sound (by Kishan Sharma)

Below documents the **sound** setup that I used for 3 MTW Improv shows in [Avon drama studio](/wiki/04-spaces/03-avon.md) in the 23/24 academic year.
I found no systemic issues with the band monitor making the room too loud.
I had no big problems with feedback due to this setup.
I also found no issues while working with the band in terms of scope-creep due to giving them a vocal and band channel to their own monitor mixer.
Your milage may vary and of course when you're on the show its up to you to design the setup, this is all just what worked for me and my opinion!

### PA 

For main PA, use two LVX on their stands at the front, placed out of the way of: the performance space, the whiteboard, and the band.

### Band Monitoring 

To provide the band monitoring, use the [MTW active sound desk](https://usa.yamaha.com/news_events/2002/20020117_yamaha-emx5000-series-mixers-just-add-speakers_us.html) to drive their passive speaker stored in the avon cupboard.
These just need 13A power, as the mixer has a built-in amp that can drive the speaker!
To send things out the band monitor, first route them out the SQ5 stagebox, and provide them as inputs to the MTW mixer.
Make a mix with all the vocal channels post fade, then make a second mix with all the band channels pre fade.
Send these mixes down the ethercon cable to 2 outputs on stagebox in the band pit.
This allows the band control over making the vocals the right level, which eliminates the biggest complaint from the band i.e. not being able to hear cast.

Band will normally be keys, bass, guitar, drums.

## Lighting (by Echo Vaughan)
Below documents the **lighting** setup in [Avon drama studio](/wiki/04-spaces/03-avon.md) throughout the 23/24 Academic year.
To ensure that the lights don't snap when changing colour, you must create a playback fader to adjust the fade speed because it looks better. Please don't ask me how to do this because I don't know.

### Backlights
Right against the back wall, there are 4 cobs (clamps removed) pointing directly upwards and evenly spaced apart which lights the wall. This allows fun colours to be displayed behind the cast, making the lighting more interesting than just having facelights.

### Facelights
The other 2 cobs are champed on to the lighting stands on either side of the main doors to be used as facelights. Power and DMX need to be taped together and run over the door frame so they don't become a trip hazard.

### Equipment list

| Equipment | Cables | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
|**6 Lumipar StudioCobs**| Powercon, Powercon-13A and DMX including the 20m cable  | 20m cable needed to reach back of Avon from tech area |
| **ZeroS FLX** | Powercon true 1-13A | Cable in flx flight case |
| **Lighting Stands** | 13A extension leads | Make sure you have the t bars to go on top of the stands|
