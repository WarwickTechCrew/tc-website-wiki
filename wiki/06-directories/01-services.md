# Equipment Hire & Services Directory

Sources for various equipment Tech Crew doesn't have!

## On Campus

### Warwick SU Tech Services

We often work with SU tech services on special events, as they have a lot of equipment more suited for live events that
we don't have. Similarly, they regularly rent our radio mics.

### AV Services

The University's AV services offer a range of equipment to borrow
[on their website](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/av/bbav/equipment), most of which isn't very
relevant to Tech Crew on a regular basis. Kit can only be borrowed to staff, although staff can borrow equipment on
behalf of students.

However, they do sometimes have other kit to borrow on request, and can be especially helpful for hires and conferences
in centrally timetabled rooms (such as WES) where they can provide additional mics and equipment, as well as direct
access to the rooms' hard patching to save running cables everywhere.

Contact: form on [website](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/its/servicessupport/av/bbav/equipment).

### IT Services

In the library, IT services offer
[loans of some equipment](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/it-students/computers/laptop-loans/) such as laptops and quite
usefully short-term iPad loans if you need an extra control surface.

They can also offer setting up networking and patching ports for internet access around campus (including outdoors) if
emailed with enough notice.

Contact: for device loans: form on [website](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/it-students/computers/laptop-loans/) or
in-person at the library. For networking help: [Service-Now Service Desk](https://warwick.service-now.com/sp)

### Estates

Can offer power hookups and assorted distribution in various outdoor locations around campus. Also has a 63A 3-phase
generator which can sometimes be used.

Contact: [Estates Service Desk](https://helpdesk.estate.warwick.ac.uk/helpdesk) or <Estates.Servicedesk@warwick.ac.uk>.

### Music Centre

The Music Centre has a bunch of various equipment, both technical and non technical. They have lots of music stands,
keyboards, amps etc. that can be borrowed, as well as a Midas M32R mixer. Also of note is the music production studio
with recording and editing facilities (which could be useful for voiceovers in shows, or sound design).

### Warwick Arts Centre

Obviously in regular use for shows, they can sometimes offer equipment hire outside the WAC if asked nicely. This can,
however, often be quite expensive.

### Event Production (Warwick Conferences)

The department that does the tech for Warwick Conferences has a good range of equipment. We've used one of their sound
desks (they have a range of A&H SQ series desks with Dante) for a training before, and I'm sure they'd be willing to
hire other equipment if asked nicely like the WAC.

### Warwick SU Operations

Warwick SU Operations can sometimes provide tables and chairs for outdoor events if asked nicely and pending
availability.

Contact: email Steve Russell (Warwick SU Commercial/Ops) at <steve.russell@warwicksu.com>.

### Digital Signage Team

The digital signage team manage the Big Screen in the Piazza and most of the screens around campus. Content can be
uploaded to these using the
[Online Form](https://warwick.ac.uk/services/engagementgroup/marketing/digitalengagement/screens/), which may take up to
two weeks to be processed.

With enough notice and availability, it is also possible to livestream to the Big Screen from a service such as YouTube.
Both the Digital Signage Team and AV Team (Andrew Maddison) need to be contacted for this to take place. Additionally,
custom dynamic content can be added to digital signage provided even more advance notice and knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS.
Email Digital Signage at <digitalscreens@warwick.ac.uk> for this, and they should direct you to the right person (Ed!).

## Hire Companies

When using hire companies, note that these may often require a higher lead time with advance payment or deposit. You
will also need to consider delivery/collection costs, or be able to organise alternative transport.

### Marklew Productions

We regularly use Marklew Productions for hiring Ayrton Ghibli moving heads for shows, but they have a big range of tech
for dry hire. If you say you're from Tech Crew hiring things for a student event they usually give a great price!

Website: <https://www.marklewproductions.com>

### Impact Production Services (IPS)

One of the big national hire companies, based in Milton Keynes. We've used them for an event or two, their particular
strength is having a great website with a full list of equipment and prices. The delivery and collection price can be
fairly brutal though for the quantities of equipment we use, so this is best if there's a car available to drive there.

Website: <https://www.ips.co.uk>

### DCRS

We used DCRS for hiring radios for WSAF 2024. They have good relations with Warwick SU so are generally able to offer a
good discount.

Website: <https://www.dcrs.co.uk>

### BE Event Hire

BE Event Hire can supply furniture (e.g. tables and chairs) for events. Chairs start at Â£1.40 exc. VAT per week, and
tables at Â£7.00 exc. VAT per week. All items and prices are listed on their website.

Website: <https://www.beeventhire.co.uk>

## Societies

### UWCS (CompSoc)

UWCS have video stuff aimed at livestreaming talks and their annual WASD speedrunning event. Stock includes:

- ATEM Mini Extreme Pro ISO (yes, there's a good few of these around)
- Panasonic Lumix GH5 (is however broken currently (2025) so might change
- RÃ˜DE Wireless GO II radio mics (2 transmitters)
- Behringer XR-18 digital mixer

Contact: email <techteam@uwcs.co.uk> or message on [Discord](https://discord.uwcs.co.uk).

### RaW (Radio at Warwick)

They have a good stock of cameras and things inherited from the defunct Warwick TV when it merged into RaW visual, and
are willing to collaborate on events too. Relevant equipment includes:

- 4 or 5 ENG style camcorders
- ATEM Mini Pro ISO
- Lots of HDMI cables
- Heavy-duty video tripods
- Some unspecified lapel radio mics

### CU (Christian Union)

The CU have weekly meetings with live music and have assorted equipment to support this that can be useful:

- Music, instrument and mic stands
- A pair of Sennheiser XSW handheld radio mics
- Some other handheld and lapel radio mics of debatable quality
- Spirit LX7 16-channel sound mixer
- SRM 350v3 PA
- Roland cube street monitor
- Amplifiers
- Microphones (including those for a cajon) and DIs
- Fire extinguishers

Contact: email <tech@warwickcu.org>.

### TEDx

Like UWCS, TEDx have some video equipment for recording their events - of particular note is their Blackmagic Pocket
Cinema Camera 4K (they might buy more in the future too)!
