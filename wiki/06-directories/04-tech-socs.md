# University Tech and Theatre Society Directory

If you enjoy going on deep dives of what other unis have, this page is for you! With all our equivalents at other
universities (that I've come across at least, I'm sure there are many more).

## [York TechSoc](https://yorktechsoc.org/)

Probably the society that's closest in what we do. AdamRMS was originally written for them, and we totally didn't steal
the idea for a [Docusaurus based website](https://yorktechsoc.org/docs/category/where-we-work) from them either
(as well as the idea of hires assistants)! ~~They have a whole drama studio with dressing rooms and storage to themselves
on the York campus, which is very cool.~~ Their building got mothballed :(

## [York DramaSoc](https://www.yorkdramasoc.com/)

York's drama society have up to 48 shows a year, in their very own "Drama Barn" space. Their website doesn't exist at
the time of writing but there's the
["Barn Bible"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3b3ZFxVWKakrXMquYUU2sQv9_lJz9XNJIYo6r1l-Rk/edit?usp=sharing) in
their [linktree](https://linktr.ee/uoydramasoc) which explains how they work, kind of like this wiki!

## [Nottingham New Theatre](https://newtheatre.org.uk/)

England's only student-run theatre, the Nottingham New Theatre ~~has an 86-seat main theatre and two 30-seat studios~~
is currently closed for "refurbishment" with no date for reopening. Currently, they are based in a temporary performance
space in the Portland (SU) Building. They have a [fantastic history site](https://history.newtheatre.org.uk/), with
records of shows going back to 1950. Every summer, they run [Student Fringe Festival (StuFF)](https://newtheatre.org.uk/stuff/)
for student and professional theatre makers to showcase their work.

## [TEC PA & Lighting (Nottingham)](https://www.nottinghamtec.co.uk/)

Also at the University of Nottingham, TEC seem to have a lot of cool equipment, running tech for the Uni's grad ball
and doing a lot more external hires for companies around Nottingham. Members get
[Â£15.25 for crew food at or after events](https://join.nottinghamtec.co.uk/). They also have a moose as
their mascot, which is fun.

## [Bedlam Theatre (Edinburgh)](https://www.bedlamtheatre.co.uk/)

Like the new theatre in Nottingham, Edinburgh's Bedlam Theatre is a student-run theatre, based in a church. Their
website holds an archive of shows like Nottingham's, only going back to 1871! They also have an
[incredible wiki](https://wiki.bedlamtheatre.co.uk/).

## [Ents Crew (St Andrew's)](https://entscrew.net/)

Ents Crew are technically not a society, but a direct part of St Andrew's Students' Union. This means they perform both
the role of doing SU tech (like Warwick SU Tech Services), but also random tech for student events like we do. They have
[an excellent page of lore on their wiki](https://wiki.entscrew.net/doku.php?id=ents:lore:book).

## [Imperial DramSoc](https://dramsoc.org/)

At Imperial, the tech society is half of the drama society, but they also do tech on a very big scale (including the
Imperial Grad Ball), with alumni often sticking around to help with big events. It's a bit like all of the DC and Tech
Crew combined into one society and made bigger. They have what I'm told is an excellent wiki (featuring a page on a
nuclear reactor), but unfortunately its all being a login gate.

Like many other drama societies, they have their own space in the Imperial Union Concert Hall, which they share with
Imperial Cinema.

## [Manchester Universities Technical Theatre Society](https://mutts.org.uk/)

MUTTS was founded in 2013 and provides technical support and equipment hire for societies and organisations around
Manchester, working in the
[SU Theatre](https://manchesterstudentsunion.com/room-booking/theatre)/[Theatre Lounge](https://manchesterstudentsunion.com/room-booking/theatre-lounge)
and storing all equipment in a storage facility known as The Arch. They meet every Tuesday and have frequent trainings
and socials, and also seem to stock a lot of equipment including intelligent lighting, truss, steel deck and power
distro (and a lot of flight cases!). Whilst they have a [wiki](https://wiki.mutts.org.uk), most of this is only
available to members.

## [Technical Services Committee (TEC) (Sheffield)](https://tsc.sites.sheffield.ac.uk/)
TSC is a Working Committee of the Sheffield Students' Union, run by students and supported by staff in its Technical
Services department. They seem to run weekly training sessions on Wednesday and have a lot of cool equipment and
software, including a dLive sound desk, Avolights lighting desks and Resolume Arena.
