# Demons & Ghouls Directory

List of the Demons and Ghouls that haunt Warwick Tech Crews operations. If something went wrong on show, consult this
page to identify which demon or ghoul was responsible.

## Studio Demon

The first recorded evidence of the Studio Demon was during the show week for MTW's Godspell (23/24). The Demon took up
residence inside one of the WAC's EMS-81X speakers, which was being used as the main PA. This caused a really annoying
low hissing to be constantly output from the speakers. No amount of tweaking the amp settings or swapping out cables was
able to evict the studio demon from the speaker. It is assumed that because of our attempts to remove the demon from its
home, the demon turned off the PA power during preshow and decided to drop one of our mic packs on the floor just before
the final number. When the demon did travel outside its buzzing speaker home, it found its way to the walls behind the
band pit. The demon was detected as electrical current running through those walls, which created a low hum feedback via
interference with the bass guitar. This caused the whole band pit to shake during the climax of the louder numbers. This
put the band members in great peril, as the pit was located up on 8ft high steeldeck poles. It is important to note here
that the northern lights were visibe during this show week. Therefore, we place all blame on the Aurora Borealis for any
mishappening or misfortune during MTW's Godspell (23/24), and not on the incompetencies of any co-sound designers.

## S21 Demon

This creature made its home in WAC's DiGiCo S21 sound desk. During 23/24 Company, we very reasonably decided to load
200+ scenes into the main showfile. The S21 Demon did not approve of this approach to DCA management, and subsequently
cast a delay curse on the S21's next scene button, causing a lag of about 5 seconds each time a scene needed to change.

## FLX Demon

This spirit possesses the FLX lighting desk, turning the house lights on and off, and generally producing the exact
opposite of what you're trying to do. For example, the demon interprets pressing the "Home" button to mean "put all the
lights at max white brightness instantly".
During FreshFest (24/25) show up, the FLX Demon cast a light-not-turning-on spell on two of the LumiPars. It is believed 
that the demon was so enamoured by the opening passages that it forced a full restart just to relive the experience once more.
