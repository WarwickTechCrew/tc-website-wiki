# Makka Pakka & Friends Directory

Makka Pakka and his collection of friends are one of the most important parts of Tech Crew - they help improve crew
morale and are an essential part to any large show or hire.

## Makka Pakka

Makka Pakka was gifted to Josh (Tech Crew Treasurer 23/24) at the start of the 2024 academic year, and since then, Tech
Crew has never been the same.

Makka Pakka made his first Tech Crew debut at [Arrivals Stage 2024](/wiki/case-studies/arrivals-2024), where he
frequently helped out in the tech tent or filled in on stage when needed. Makka Pakka also particularly helped by
filling in for a DJ set in one of the last events of the day.

Makka Pakka has also featured at other hires including the Christmas Lights Switch-on 2024, and the Christian Union's
Weekend Away. It was at the Weekend Away, however, that Makka Pakka was first attacked in the middle of the night due to
his growing popularity. He luckily escaped safely, but it was a grave reminder of the dangers that can come with
stardom.

Makka Pakka also made an appearance at Can You Teach Me How To Breathe 2025, briefly gracing the occupants of a
submarine of the mind with its visage.

## Barry the Baguette

Barry the Baguette is one of Makka Pakka's closest friends. Wherever there is Barry the Baguette, Makka Pakka is likely
to be close by.

Barry also has a particular love for operating the [SQ5 Sound Desk](/wiki/disciplines/sound/sound-desks), fitting
perfectly at the top.

## The Great IKEA Trip of Term 1, 2024

On the 1 October 2024, several Tech Crew Members embarked on a quest to IKEA in the SU IKEA trip. This was a great time
full of important set research, swedish meatball consumption and battery buying, but most importantly, it was a time for
Makka Pakka to find new friends.

## Leli the Bulldog

Leli is another of Makka Pakka's friends, originating from the 2025 MTW hit musical Anything Goes! His favourite pastime
is sitting on Connie's DSM desk during Act 2, overlooking her work with glee.

## Kishan, Josh and Danny

Kishan, Josh and Danny are three British paper plates originating from the UWCS cupboards in Department of Computer
Science (DCS) - it is likely that they are rescues from the waste of a previous Warwick Food Group-catered DCS event.
Following a late-night campus tour and Tesco trip (in which much cake was consumed), they were adopted by Tech Crew
member Rowan and accompanied them on a visit to Belgium.

During the Easter holiday of 2025 they have been on (and are expecting to go on) many adventures. This is awaiting being
documented on the Tech Crew Wiki as perhaps one of the most important pieces of information to be added.
