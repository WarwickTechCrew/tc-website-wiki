# Websites & Groups Directory

This directory lists useful/fun AV websites and Facebook groups.

## Facebook Groups

### [AV Rigging Disasters](https://www.facebook.com/groups/avriggingdisasters)

Contains lots of posts of tech and rigging going wrong. Frequently includes videos of massive stages and line arrays
being blown around in the wind. Highly recommended.

### [Everything Stage Lighting](https://www.facebook.com/groups/everythingstagelighting)

Contains random posts about lighting in general. There's sometimes some interesting stuff, and people asking for advice.

### [stage crew jobs UK](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1212409432138704)

A much smaller group, sometimes has small opportunities which might be interesting. Kind of needs flexibility and
transport though.
