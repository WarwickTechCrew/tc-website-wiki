# University Showers

The University of Warwick has a number of showers available for use by students and staff. This is useful for events
such as the [Warwick Student Arts Festival](https://wsaf.org.uk) which can involve staying on campus overnight.

[Estates maintain a map](https://warwick.ac.uk/about/campus-journey/mode-of-travel/cycling) of showers on campus along
with other cycling facilities, however this may not be fully up to date. [Warwick's Campus Map](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/)
also shows the location of showers within each building, but this may be harder to navigate/list.

Currently we do not know of any showers that are available 24/7 (i.e. after 10pm).

## [Faculty of Arts Building (FAB)](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8866421e6f5928c0c937?projectId=warwick)

The FAB contains an accessible shower between the theatre dressing rooms and four additional unisex showers on the
ground floor - more information can be found on their
[FAQ](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/news/fabuserguide?selectedLetter=t#toilets-and-showers).

This building is only open [during the day (7am - 10pm)](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/news/fabuserguide?selectedLetter=o#opening-times).

## [Mathematical Sciences Building (MSB)](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c8865421e6f5928c0c8e1?projectId=warwick)

The MSB has a number of unisex showers available for use on floor 1 to 5. Note that this is only accessible to
maths/computer science students during the day (7am - 10pm), unless you have a staff card in those departments.

## [Warwick Sports and Wellness Hub](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/66475ac4d8dbf518cbed2fe0?projectId=warwick)

If you have a gym or swim membership at the Sports Hub, you can use the showers there.

## [Warwick Arts Centre](https://campus.warwick.ac.uk/search/623c885e421e6f5928c0c7cd?projectId=warwick)

The Warwick Arts Centre has many showers backstage, however unless working on a production in the Arts Centre this
should be avoided if possible.
