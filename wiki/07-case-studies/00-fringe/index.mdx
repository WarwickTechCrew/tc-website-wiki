# Improv @ Fringe

## Day 

Night before:
- Bring the batteries home from the venue
- Put them on charge in the house next to your bed

Before you leave the house:
- Bring the batteries with you!!

Before get in:
- know who is performing and ask them what teeshirt colour they are. 
- Figure out your channel list
- - What number mic pack does each person get,
- - What order to put the tape markers on the sound desk

Waiting outside venue for previous show to finish:
- Mic up cast. bend the mic wires into place, if its too loose, do a big pinch in the middle back of the wire 
- Make sure its not too tight or loose for them
- Give the host the handheld mic (turned on)
- give them each the correct numbered mic pack (turned on)

Get in:
- let the venue technician load your showfile
- wire up the band pit
- - XLR 1 -> DI -> Keys
- - XLR 2 -> Bass Amp
- - XLR 3 -> DI -> Guitar
- Move the foldback monitors into place
- tape up the cast channels on the sound desk as per your notes
- soundcheck cast mics first, adjusting gain to get them heard out the main speakers (adjusting gain until the metering is peeking into the orange)

During show:
- enjoy the songs! it is meant to be fun!
- remember that the host comes back on halfway through to "put our fingers back in the pies" so turn their mic on for this.

Get out:
- move the monitors out the way of the picture
- unplug the band
- collect cast RM's (get people to help you with this e.g. the LX person and prod team)
- take the battery box home

home:
- charge the batteries overnight.
